# Steel Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains the Applied Machine Learning project for
the course **Applied Machine & Deep Learning (190.015)** at
Montanuniversität Leoben.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict a continuous steel quality factor
using supervised regression models trained on normalized process data.

## Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- KNN Regressor
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor

## Evaluation Metrics
- MAE
- MSE
- RMSE
- R² Score

## Files
- `data/` – training and test datasets
- `notebook/` – Jupyter notebook with full implementation
- `report/` – project report (PDF)
